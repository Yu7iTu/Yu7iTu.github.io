Hello, I am Yuqi Tu, a senior majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at UW-Madison. Before coming to Madison, I spent two years at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I am very interested in high-dimensional statistics and theoretical foundation of data sciences, and I am very honored to be mentored by Prof. [Benedek Valko](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~valko/), Prof. [Ilias Diakonikolas](http://www.iliasdiakonikolas.org), and Prof. [Joshua Cape](https://jcape1.github.io/).
