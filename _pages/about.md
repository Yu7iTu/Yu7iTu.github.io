Hello, I am Yuqi Tu, a rising senior majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at UW-Madison. Before coming to Madison, I spent two years at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I am very interested in high-dimensional statistics and theoretical foundation of data sciences, and I am very honored to be mentored by Prof. Benedek Valko, Prof. Ilias Diakonikolas, and Prof. Joshua Cape.
